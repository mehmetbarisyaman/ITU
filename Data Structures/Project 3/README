WORKING WITH THE PROGRAM

For Mac Terminals or ssh firstly we use this command to return the desktop:

cd Desktop

Then for opening a file, we again use the same command:

cd filename

When we reach the file that has the source and header files of  the program we use this command to compile the codes:

g++ main.cpp operations.cpp

After compiling the codes a.out file must be created in that file and the program is ready for start. Then to start the program, we write this command:

./a.out

Then the program is started and an output file must be created and written. Then, we open the output file and see the result of the program.
